    "It will have 3 methods:\n",

    " - `forward` - responsible for flow of data during a forward pass\n",

    "- code them as word embeddings\n",
    "- input them into LSTM layer\n",
    "- flatten its output\n",

Then, they will be processed in parallel, by units LSTM-0, LSTM-1 and LSTM-2. Each of these units will try to predict the next word in a sequence, but you already know that after B comes F and that after F comes C. You can tell it from the original sequence. The only interesting prediction is that for the last word, C, because you can't guess it just by looking at the input sequence.\n",

    "\n",
    "My general idea during model tuning was to keep the model simple. If e.g. increase in hidden dimension improved the loss but only slightly, I would move back to the previous value.\n",
    "\n",
    "`seq_length` affects how the model works. Just think about how prediction based on 5 words can differ from a one based on 10. Text generated by the latter model is probably more consistent as it can get a better grasp of context, since there are more words to learn from. I started with 5, but then increased it to 10 and the results seem to make more sense than before.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general good value for `batch_size` is either 32, 64, 128 or 256. I decided to keep it at 128. As you may know, training accuracy is proportional to `batch_size` * `learning_rate` so I decided to focus on tuning the learning rate instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for `learning_rate`, I tried both 0.005 and 0.0005, but it seemed that 0.001 works better.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can remember that on the input and output of the network there is a one-hot encoded vector. `vocab_size` and `output_size` simply determine its length. And you should set it to the number of unique words.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Google Developers' blog entry, there is a simple formula for a good `embedding_dim` value. It is the 4th root of the number of classes. Here, classes refer to unique words, so the result is approximately 21,000 ** 0.25 ~ 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "I set `num_epochs` to 20. You can notice that I reach my goal at epoch 9 as it is the first time that loss falls below 3.5. But it makes sense to continue training until the network converges. And it seems that it is close to this point at epoch 20. You can tell it by smaller and smaller drops in loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, a good value of `n_layers` is between 1 to 3. The middle 2 was enough to get good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with most parameters, you need to experiment. I tried a range of parameters for `hidden_dim` and the loss decreases nicely at 200."
